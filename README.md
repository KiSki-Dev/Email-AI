# Please note, this project is still in progress. 

# Email‑AI: an AI interface that allows you to chat with an AI via email.

## ❗ Because the project is not released yet, there is no email address available for testing. Please be patient or set it up yourself, but be aware of potential issues!
> A public email address will be provided once it’s released!

### Currently supported features:
- Send a question to Google Gemini AI and receive an instant response via email.
- Select a Gemini model before asking a question.
- Support for images, audio, video, and PDF attachments.
- Chat with the AI in multi-turn conversations within the same email thread.
- Encrypted (secure) database to store chats.
- User system (free, premium, and developer plans coming soon).

### To‑Do:
- [ ] Reasoning support
- [ ] Support for other AI models (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- [ ] Secure user‑data database
- [ ] Dedicated website for user registration
- [ ] Additional error handling and testing for other email providers (currently only tested with Gmail)

**The project is currently limited to Google Gemini models due to cost constraints.**

**It also depends on the Gmail API to send and receive emails. Future support for other email providers (without Gmail API dependency) is planned.**
